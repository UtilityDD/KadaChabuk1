        <h1>Privacy Policy for Kada Chabuk</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: October 25, 2025</p>

        <p>Thank you for using Kada Chabuk ("the App"). This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use our application. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The Kada Chabuk app is designed to work with minimal data collection. The information handled by the app can be categorized as follows:</p>

        <h3>User-Generated Data (Stored Locally)</h3>
        <p>The app stores certain data that you create directly on your device to provide its features. This data is not transmitted to us or any third party and remains on your device. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Any text you save in the "My Notes" section.</li>
            <li><strong>Bookmarks and Favorites:</strong> Chapters you bookmark and videos you mark as favorites.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading History:</strong> Statistics about which chapters you've read and for how long.</li>
            <li><strong>Search History:</strong> Queries you have previously searched for.</li>
            <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Your selected language, theme (light/dark), and preferred font size.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Non-Personal Information (Network Usage)</h3>
        <p>The app requires an internet connection for certain functions. When it connects to the internet, standard network requests are made, which may include non-personal information like your IP address. This happens for the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Downloading Content:</strong> To download or update chapter data, "About" information, and video lists from our public Google Sheets database.</li>
            <li><strong>In-App Updates:</strong> To check for and download new versions of the app via the Google Play Store.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Playback:</strong> To stream videos from third-party services like YouTube.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, location, or contacts.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The data stored on your device is used exclusively to provide and enhance your experience with the App:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To display your saved notes, bookmarks, and reading history.</li>
            <li>To remember your language and theme preferences.</li>
            <li>To provide relevant search suggestions based on your history.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Network access is used solely to fetch content and check for app updates.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All user-generated data (notes, bookmarks, etc.) is stored in the app's private storage on your device. We do not have access to this data. You have full control over this data and can delete it at any time through the app's "Reset Reading History" or "Delete All Notes" features.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> For handling in-app updates. Their handling of data is governed by Google's Privacy Policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Sheets:</strong> As a database to provide the app's content.</li>
            <li><strong>YouTube:</strong> For embedding and streaming video content. Your interaction with the YouTube player is subject to YouTube's Terms of Service and Google's Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
